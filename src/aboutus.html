                        <p class="mt-3">In view of the socio-economic situation that Lebanon is going through NGOs are working hard
                            to
                            meet the needs of the most deprived as much as possible. But the organization is complicated
                            by
                            the decentralized work and the lack of communication
                            between NGOs. We decided to create a centralised platform that keeps track of the
                            population’s
                            needs and helps coordinate the work of NGOs to support the largest number of people in need.
