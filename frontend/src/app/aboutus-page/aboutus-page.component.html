            <p>In view of the socio-economic situation that Lebanon is going through NGOs are working hard to meet the needs of the most deprived as much as possible. But the organization is complicated by the decentralized work and the lack of communication
                between NGOs. We decided to create a centralised platform that keeps track of the population’s needs and helps coordinate the work of NGOs to support the largest number of people in need.
